   <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p class="dic-p">A unique invention, the French taco has little in common with a traditional Mexican taco.

    <li> 6 chicken fingers, frozen, homemade, or store-bought </li>
    <li>1½ cups french fries, frozen, homemade, or store-bought </li>
    <li>½ cup crème fraîche </li>
    <li>½ cup Gruyère, shredded </li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh dill, finely chopped </li>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
        <li>Cook the chicken fingers and french fries according to the package or recipe directions. Skip this step if using leftover or store-bought chicken and fries.</li>
        <li>In a small pot, melt the crème fraîche and Gruyère together. </li>
        <li>Season the cheese sauce with dill, salt, and pepper. </li>
        <li>Place the tortillas on a flat, clean surface. </li>
        <li>Divide the cheese sauce between the tortillas and spread it into an even layer. </li>

        <li>Add a squiggle of ketchup or other condiments, if desired. </li>
